# Risk Parity Portfolio Implementation

## Project Overview
This project implements a risk parity portfolio strategy based on AQR's "Understanding Risk Parity" research paper. It was completed as a group project at Columbia University, combining theoretical understanding with practical implementation.

## Key Features
- Implementation of risk parity portfolio optimization
- Comparison of traditional vs. factor-based approaches
- Momentum ranking implementation
- Performance analysis and visualization
- Integration of multiple risk factors

## Project Structure
- `FinalProject.ipynb`: Main implementation of the risk parity strategy
- `Functions - Group members.ipynb`: Individual contributions and function implementations
- `Final Presentation.pptx`: Project presentation and results
- `sources/`: Research papers and reference materials

## Individual Contribution
My participation in the project included the following:
- Explored and implemented momentum ranking functionality
- Contributed to the final project integration
- Participated in the final presentation development

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- yfinance
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scipy

## References
- AQR's "Understanding Risk Parity" research paper
- Additional research papers in the `sources/` directory

## Group Project Context
This implementation was developed as part of a course project at Columbia University, focusing on modern portfolio theory and risk parity strategies. The project demonstrates practical application of theoretical concepts in portfolio management.
